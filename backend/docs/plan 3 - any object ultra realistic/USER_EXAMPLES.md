## Tips for Best Results

### For Engineering Objects (Parametric)
✅ **DO**:
- Specify exact dimensions (mm, cm)
- Mention features (hollow, threaded, tapered)
- Be precise about shape (cylinder, box, etc.)

❌ **DON'T**:
- Use vague sizes ("small", "big")
- Mix with artistic descriptions
- Expect organic curves

### For Organic Objects (AI)
✅ **DO**:
- Use descriptive words (realistic, detailed)
- Mention textures (fur, scales, smooth)
- Describe pose or appearance

❌ **DON'T**:
- Expect precise dimensions
- Require exact CAD accuracy
- Use with engineering parts

### For Hybrid Objects
✅ **DO**:
- Combine functional base with decoration
- Specify which part needs precision
- Use clear descriptions for both aspects

❌ **DON'T**:
- Expect perfect AI + parametric blend (still experimental)
- Overly complex combinations
